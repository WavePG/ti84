1. KEY is what is used to say when exactly it was made (down to the month)
   the first number e.g. 6, is the number of years from 2018
   the second number e.g. 8, is the number of months from/since April
   In Ver. 1.0, April was 0, March was 11. Somewhere along the way
   April became 1, and March became 12. This is standardized
   to the later in Ver. 2.0


Text Formatting
---
New in Ver. 2.0, all text should be UPPERCASE
- This is to avoid differences between programs
- Easier to edit on Calculator
