MULTITAB 4.2.0
=
The **MULTITAB** project is some code I wrote to: display the multiplication tables of numbers (between 2 and 9999), and also list perfect squares (up to 100).

TIRAD 1.7

**TIRAD** on the other hand: turns a number into its radical form, for example: *√80* will be printed in radical form as *4√5*.

MATRIXIT 1.1.7
=
The program **MATRIXIT** easily solves and shows all the steps to get an augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form (rref). To input, put a 3x4 Matrix in using 2nd+Matrix > Edit > [A].
Original Matrix *has* to be [A]
