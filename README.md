MULTITAB
=
The **MULTITAB** project is some code I wrote to: display the multiplication tables (up to 999 from 2) of numbers, and perfect squares.

TIRAD
=
**TIRAD** on the other hand: turns a number into its radical form, for example: *√80* will be printed in radical from as *2√20*.
The **+** key goes further to simplify and if it can't it'll just repeat the same number.
*2√20* simplified is *4√5*. Howver, that cannot be simplified further, so it repeats that number.
